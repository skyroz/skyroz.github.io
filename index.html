    <p>My name is Elias Turner and I am an artist, writer and web developer from El Cerrito, CA.
      <br>
      Currently, I reside in Vista, CA.</p>
<br>
     My hobbies include:
<ul>
  <li>Motorsports (watching, not driving)</li>
      <li>Reading (both fiction and non-fiction)</li>
      <li>Drawing</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
	I started studying HTML, CSS and Javascript coding in December 2023. I am currently 44% percent complete with my Front End Engineering Professional Cert. course but I am to learn a lot more, including back-end engineering, APIs, and so on. My aim is to work less and make more--For the last two years, I've worked two jobs concurrently (at one point, 3 different jobs) and not had enough time to work on my drawing and writing--which I would like to be able to spend a lot more time on.

      <h3 class="Heading2">My Goal with Coding is to build the kind of life for myself that I want to live</h3>
    <p>
      I love art and coding equally, though I see them somewhat differently. The way I look at is is this: Art is, of course, creative expression. As for code, I see it as a public service and the focus should be on the end user, not on increasing profits. The exception for this is code that is explicitly being labelled as artistic expression i.e. video games, interactive art, etc. Artists should be able to choose whether or not they want to copyright their art.  Code should be seen as a utility that we need in our society to provide us opportunities to gain better control over our own lives with software that makes our lives easier and turns big problems into smaller, much more <i>manageable</i> ones
