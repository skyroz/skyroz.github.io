	I started studying HTML, CSS and Javascript coding in December 2023. I have an Associates Degree in Liberal Arts (Emphasis in Social Sciences) from Miracosta College. I now have a certification in Front End Engineering and am a freelance web designer.  I got into coding because I was tired of working 2-3 jobs at a time to be able to afford the kind of life I wanted to live.

    <p>
      I love art and coding, though I see them somewhat differently. The way I look at is is this: Art is, of course, creative expression. As for code, I see it more so as a public service and the focus should be on the end user, not on increasing profits. The exception for this is code that is explicitly being labelled as artistic expression i.e. video games, interactive art, etc. Artists should be able to choose whether or not they want to copyright their art.  Code should be seen as a utility that we need in our society to provide us opportunities to gain better control over our own lives with software that makes our lives easier and turns big problems into smaller, much more <i>manageable</i> ones
